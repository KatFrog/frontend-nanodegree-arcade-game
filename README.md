Avoid the Bugs!!!
===============================

Welcome to my simple, classic arcade game - The Self-Rescuing Princess!


Instructions:
1. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your character around.
2. Avoid being in the same spot as the enemy bugs.
3. When you collide with a bug, your character goes back to the starting position and you lose a life.
4. You win the game by making it to the water before the bugs get you.
5. You lose the game if you run out of lives.
