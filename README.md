Rescue the Princess!!!
===============================

Welcome to my simple, classic arcade game - Rescue the Princess!

Here you try to lead the princess to the water, past the bug roadway.  If a
bug touches the princess, she immediately goes back to where she started.  If
she gets across, you win.  You can play at the game at
https://katfrog.github.io/rescue-the-princess/.  Or you can download the code
and run the index.html file.

This game only runs reliably on PCs using Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.


Instructions:
1. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your character around.
2. Avoid being in the same spot as the enemy bugs.
3. When you collide with a bug, your character goes back to the starting position.
4. You win the game by making it to the water before the bugs get you.
